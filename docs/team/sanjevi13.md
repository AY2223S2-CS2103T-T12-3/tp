### Project: ExpressLibrary

ExpressLibrary is an app for librarians to keep track of books borrowed by students.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: 
    * What it does: Created the book class in the initial milestone.
    * Justification: This is the base of the entire app and everything we develop starts from here
    * Highlights: This was initially given to me and Glen, but it was a hard task to split so we sat down and coded out the class together
    * Credits: 

* **New Feature**: 

* **Code contributed**: 
  * Added the initial book object in v1.1 that was modified in later milestones, and also modified JSON property ([Glen's commit](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2223S2/tp/commit/668f87ca849a2cc850b409df46d3e0dcc555df82))

  * Update find commands ([#107](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/107))
  * Resolved some bugs from PED and added test cases

* **Project management**:
