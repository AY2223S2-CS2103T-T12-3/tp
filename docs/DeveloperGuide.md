### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/expresslibrary/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/expresslibrary/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deletePerson 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/expresslibrary/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `BookListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/expresslibrary/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` or `Book` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/expresslibrary/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `ExpressLibraryParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddPersonCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletePerson 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletePerson 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ExpressLibraryParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddPersonCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddPersonCommand`) which the `ExpressLibraryParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPersonCommandParser`, `DeletePersonCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/expresslibrary/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the ExpressLibrary data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and all `Book` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueBookList`).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change. Similar process for `Book` objects as well.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `ExpressLibrary`, which `Person` references. This allows `ExpressLibrary` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/expresslibrary/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both express library data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ExpressLibraryStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `expresslibrary.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Borrow/return feature

#### Implementation

The borrow feature will allow the user to mark a book as borrowed by a person.
Similarly, the return feature will allow the user to mark a book as returned to the ExpressLibrary by a person.

It implements the following commands:

* `borrow PERSON_INDEX b/BOOK_INDEX d/DUE_DATE`
* `return PERSON_INDEX b/BOOK_INDEX`

Given below is an example usage scenario of the borrow command:

The user executes `borrow 1 b/2 d/23/11/2023` command to lend the 2nd Book in the Book list to the 1st Person in the Person list.

The `BorrowCommand` class will first retrieve the Person object and Book object from the given indexes and create a copy of them (since they are immutable) called `editedPerson` and `bookToBorrow`.

Then, it calls `borrowBook` on `editedPerson` and passes in the Book object `bookToBorrow`. This will add the Book to the Person's `Set` of books field. Similarly, the class also calls `loanBookTo` on `bookToBorrow` to update the Book's fields with the borrower, the borrow date (current date) and the due date details. 

Given below is an example usage scenario of the return command:

The user executes `return 2 b/1` command to return the 1st book in the Book list from the 2nd person in the Person list.

The `ReturnCommand` class will first retrieve the Person object and Book object from the given indexes and create a copy of them (since they are immutable) called `editedPerson` and `bookToReturn`.

Then, it calls `returnBook` on `editedPerson` and passes in the Book object `bookToReturn`. This will remove the Book from the Person's `Set` of books field. Similarly, the class also calls `returnBook` on `bookToReturn` to update and remove the Person from the Book's borrower field as well as clear the borrow and due dates.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedExpressLibrary`. It extends `ExpressLibrary` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `ExpressLibraryStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedExpressLibrary#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current express library state in its history.
* `VersionedExpressLibrary#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous express library state from its history.
* `VersionedExpressLibrary#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone express library state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitExpressLibrary()`, `Model#undoExpressLibrary()` and `Model#redoExpressLibrary()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedExpressLibrary` will be initialized with the initial express library state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single express library state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the express library. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitExpressLibrary()`, causing the modified state of the express library after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `expressLibraryStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted express library state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitExpressLibrary()`, causing another modified express library state to be saved into the `expressLibraryStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitExpressLibrary()`, so the express library state will not be saved into the `expressLibraryStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoExpressLibrary()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous express library state, and restores the express library to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial ExpressLibrary state, then there are no previous ExpressLibrary states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoExpressLibrary()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoExpressLibrary()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the express library to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `expressLibraryStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest express library state, then there are no undone ExpressLibrary states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoExpressLibrary()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the express library, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitExpressLibrary()`, `Model#undoExpressLibrary()` or `Model#redoExpressLibrary()`. Thus, the `expressLibraryStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitExpressLibrary()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `expressLibraryStateList`, all express library states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire express library.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
